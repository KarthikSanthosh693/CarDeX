Project Overview

CARDEX is a Java-based inventory management system built to simplify and digitalize the process of managing car details and customer purchase records in automobile dealerships.
It enables efficient storage, retrieval, and management of both car inventory and customer data, reducing manual errors and improving productivity.

Through a well-structured Java application integrated with a MySQL database via JDBC, CARDEX provides a reliable, secure, and responsive environment for handling real-world dealership operations.

This system demonstrates practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Database Connectivity, and Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) concepts, making it suitable for both academic and professional environments.
