How to turn these into 100+ contributions fast

Aim small, frequent PRs. Each small task above -> 1 PR. 100 small PRs = 100 contributions.

Branch-per-PR: feature/, fix/, chore/, docs/. Good naming: feature/search-filters, docs/contributing.

Keep PRs focused: one logical change per PR; include tests if code change.

Label PRs: good first issue, help wanted, documentation, bug, enhancement.

Automate: Use GitHub Actions templates to auto-run checks — those CI PRs also count as contributions when you add/adjust them.

Suggested immediate 10 PRs (quick wins)

docs/CONTRIBUTING.md (small).

docs/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md + PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md (small).

README.md update with badges + quick start (small).

Add .gitignore for Java + IntelliJ/Eclipse (small).

Add LICENSE (small).

Add GOOD_FIRST_ISSUES.md listing 10 tiny tasks (small).

Add GitHub Action: java.yml build/test (medium).

Add application.properties.example with comments (small).

Add simple unit test for Car model (small).

Add CSV export utility (medium).

That is 10 contributions before touching major features.

Tips to maximize contribution count legitimately

Break large changes into multiple logical PRs (refactor → small refactor PRs).

Add tests and docs for each change — docs-only PRs still count.

Tackle many small UX improvements (each = separate PR).

Regularly pick from GOOD_FIRST_ISSUES (community can help finish some).

Pair up: label some issues help wanted so others contribute and you shepherd PRs (counts as contributor activity if you push commits).

If you want, I can:

Create the first 10 issue templates + the CONTRIBUTING.md and produce ready-to-paste files (I’ll give full file content).

Or generate 30 good-first-issue drafts (title + description + difficulty + labels) so you can paste them into GitHub Issues.

Which of those two should I do now? (I’ll just generate the files/text right here — no waiting.)
